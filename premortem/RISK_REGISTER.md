# Risk Register

The complete R-001…R-012 register is in `plan/PLAN.md` §12. All Critical/High risks have a preventive test, gate, or blocking decision rule. Residual risks are Medium/Low: host compatibility, benchmark drift, platform numeric drift, unverified range/Fine behavior until capture, and maintenance burden.

## v3.9 addendum risk round (2026-11-02)

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| No independent fresh-context review (D-906) | High | Recorded substitution; independent review scheduled before product execution resumes | Open |
| CI-dependent checks (mutation pricing/floor, matrix jobs) not locally executable (D-905) | Medium | CI is the authoritative venue; estimates labelled; post-conditions gate in CI | Open |
| Lesson/knowledge store push pending G-003 sign-off | Low | Bundle fallback documented; does not block amendment completion | Open |

Pre-mortem rounds repeated to zero Critical risks; High risk retained honestly
with owner and mitigation.
